# GCC

- Use GCC to compile C and C++ code on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Use Visual Studio Code for editing and compiling C code cross-platform.

## What is GCC and G++?

We use G++ to compile our C and C++ code. The version of G++ we use is 4.8.5.
The compiler is called `g++` and is located in the `bin` folder of the GCC installation.
Of course you can use any other compiler you want, even [online compilers](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler).

## Why GCC?

Cross-platform C/C++ compiler. GCC is a compiler for the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and D programming languages. GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain and the standard compiler for the GNU operating system and the GNU/Linux operating system. GCC is free software, distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

### How do I get GCC?

You can get GCC from [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/).
Follow the instructions on the website to install GCC. Make sure to add the `bin` folder to your PATH.
Visual Studio Code will automatically detect the compiler and you can use it to compile your code.

The latest stable release of GCC is available from [ftp.gnu.org](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/). The latest development version of GCC is available from [gcc.gnu.org](https://gcc.gnu.org/git.html).

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is free and open source. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is available from https://code.visualstudio.com/.

Visual studio code is ideal for cross-platform development. It is also very easy to use. It has a built-in terminal and a built-in debugger. It also has a built-in Git client.
